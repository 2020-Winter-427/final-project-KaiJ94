Parameters
Name
The source designation, 4FGL JHHMM.m+DDMM[c], constructed according to the IAU Specifications for Nomenclature, in which the Right Ascension and Declination have been truncated to 0.1 decimal minutes and 1', respectively. The '4' refers to the eight-year catalog (the first-year catalog was '1'; the second-year catalog was '2'; the four-year catalog was '3') and 'FGL' represents Fermi Gamma-ray LAT. The letter at the end can be "c" (coincident with interstellar clump), "e" (extended source), "i" (for Crab nebula inverse Compton) or "s" (for Crab nebula synchrotron).

These analysis flags indicate possible issues noted in the detection or characterization of the source. A value of 0 indicates no known problem. Each condition present raises a unique bit flag. The flag values are bit-encoded into a single integer, with flag N contributing 2N-1 to the value, where N is given as:

      N=1: Source with TS > 35 which went to TS < 25 when changing the diffuse
           model. Note that sources with TS < 35 are not flagged with this bit
           because normal statistical fluctuations can push them to TS < 25.

      N=2: Not used.

      N=3: Flux (> 1 GeV) or energy flux (> 100 MeV) changed by more than 3
           sigma when changing the diffuse model or the analysis method. Requires
           also that the flux change by more than 35% (to not flag strong
           sources).
